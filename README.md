# Air Quality Analysis Based on City Population

This research project aims to explore the relationship between air quality and city population size by analyzing air pollution data from cities worldwide. Air quality is measured using the Air Quality Index (AQI), which indicates the level of pollution in the air and its potential health effects. The study categorizes cities into five groups based on population size: small, medium, large, very large, and giant cities, providing insights into how population density may influence air pollution levels.

The treemap illustrates cities worldwide based on their population sizes, with larger rectangles representing more population. The color gradient within each rectangle reflects the air quality index (AQI), 
where redder tones indicate poorer air quality and bluer tones represent better air quality. This visualization effectively highlights the relationship between population density and air quality, showing 
that many densely populated cities, such as Delhi and Chengdu, tend to have worse air quality. In contrast, smaller or less densely populated cities generally exhibit better air conditions.
